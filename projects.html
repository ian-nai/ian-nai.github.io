	<p>Cold War Archive at UT Austin - <a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/prague-spring-archive">scalar.usc.edu/works/prague-spring-archive</a></p>
  		<p2>I direct a large-scale and ongoing digital scholarship project for archival materials housed in the LBJ Presidential Library. Primary materials related to the Prague Spring and the broader Cold War are being digitized, having metadata created for them, and being made accessible via the UT Libraries’ open access, institutional repository. I created, designed, implemented, and publicized an online portal for the materials in Scalar.
		Slavic Digital Humanities Repository.</p2>
		
	<p>Digital Humanities Repository - <a href="https://github.com/ian-nai/REEES-Digital-Humanities">github.com/ian-nai/REEES-Digital-Humanities</a></p> 
	<p2>I created and curated a repository of digital humanities materials designed to complement the digital humanities space at the University of Texas at Austin's Center for Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies. The repository aims to encourage and facilitate innovation, collaboration, and exploration within the digital humanities and Slavic studies.</p2>

	<p>Digital Humanities and Pedagogy - Example Project: <a href="https://yugoslavpunk.omeka.net">yugoslavpunk.omeka.net</a> </p>
	<p2>I teach digital humanities and digital scholarship tools and methodologies in graduate and undergraduate classes, workshops for my peers, and in consultations with faculty. This has led both to student involvement in my professional DH projects (as with the Cold War Archive) and to students creating their own digital scholarship resources.</p2>

	<p>Digital Humanities Center for Area Studies</p>
	<p2>I contribute technical, information science, and librarianship expertise to the development 
		and implementation of the digital humanities space at UT Austin’s Center for Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies.
		I will teach workshops at the space, assist in cooperation between the space and the UT Libraries, and continue to provide
 		expertise and support in the future.</p2>
