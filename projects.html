				<p>Rozha - <a href="https://github.com/ian-nai/rozha" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a></p>
				<p2>A Python package to simplify and streamline a number of natural language processing processes and methods for a wide variety of languages, empowering users to use NLP on both non-English and English texts.</p2>

				<p> Non-English Natural Language Processing - <a href="https://github.com/ian-nai/Non-English-NLP-Tutorial" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a></p>
				<p2>I coded a suite of GitHub repositories dedicated to performing natural language processing (NLP) tasks on Russian and French texts. The tutorial portion of the suite, linked above, contains Jupyter notebooks with walkthroughs and sample code for performing analysis on non-English texts using various NLP methods, including Python scripts to clean, analyze, and visualize text. They were designed to accompany a workshop offered by the University of Texas Libraries.</p2>

				<p>PyGallica - <a href="https://github.com/ian-nai/PyGallica" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a> </p>
				<p2>I coded a Python wrapper for the National Library of France's digital library platform, Gallica. My wrapper is featured on the official Gallica site, and can also be found on my GitHub account at the link above.</p2>

				<p>The Simple Web Archiver - <a href="https://github.com/ian-nai/Simple-Web-Archiver" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a> </p>

				<p2>A web app for performing OCR on images within your browser using Tesseract.js and client-side Javascript. Upload one or more images, select the language of the document(s), and then view and edit the OCR-ed text in your browser (or save it as a .txt file).</p2>

				<p>Europeana Full Text in Python - <a href="https://github.com/ian-nai/Europeana-Full-Text-in-Python" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a> </p>
				<p2>I coded various Python scripts to assist with searching and downloading full text records via the Europeana APIs, including newspaper records. These scripts allow you to search records in Europeana, parse the JSON returned to obtain various metadata, and download full text if it's available. The code was featured on the Europeana site, and is hosted on my GitHub account at the link above.</p2>

				<p2>I supervised the digitization of rare and unique pamphlets held in the UT Austin collections, then created and wrote the text for the digital exhibit linked above. The exhibit is comprised of three sections, each focusing on pamphlets related to socialism and communism in, respectively, the USSR, France, and the United Kingdom.</p2>

Primary materials related to the Prague Spring and the broader Cold War are being digitized, having metadata created for them, and being made accessible via the UT Libraries’ open access, institutional repository. I created, designed, implemented, and publicized an online portal for the materials in Scalar.</p2>

				<p>Nadezhda Krupskaya Online - <a href="https://github.com/ian-nai/krupskaya">View Here</a></p>
				<p2>I created this site to provide an online home for English-language resources relating to Nadezhda Krupskaya, Deputy Education Commissar of the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1939, who played a vital role in the development and administration of Soviet librarianship and libraries.</p2>

				<p>Soviet Pamphlets Archive - <a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/soviet-pamphlets-at-ut-austin/index">View Here</a></p>
				<p2>I digitized, created metadata for, and created an Omeka site for a collection of rare and unique Soviet educational materials held by the University of Texas at Austin Libraries, ensuring the preservation and open access to the materials while making them more discoverable.</p2>
